one click electroneum miner, small step for author huge step for ETN mass adoption :) <3

start by 
- downloading zip file SimplETNApp-x64.zip (https://github.com/oviwankenobi/simplETN/blob/master/SimplETNApp-x64.zip), for now just x64 platform supported, 
- unzip it on your local machine in a dedicated folder, 
- launch simplETNApp.exe (you'll have to launch it as admin), 
- if your antivirus complains about it you'll have to add an exception for simplETNApp, some antiviruses apps are making users aware they are dealing with a miner which is only fair.

this one click electroneum miner is using xmr-stak miner tailored for this project's purpose and requirements: mainly ease of use for mass adoption.

upcoming features:

1. support for x <386 and/or AnyCPU
2. support for wallet ballence inquiry 
3. support for one time fee which will wave current dev fee
4. support for pool change, pool history and wallet ballance inquiry over the pool history
5. support for different coins: monero, sumokoin, ethereum, please suggest here more.
