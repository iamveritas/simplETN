one click electroneum miner

download the zip file SimplETNApp-x64.zip, sorry for now just x64 platform supported, unzip it, and launch simplETNApp.exe with administrator privileges, also if your antivirus complains about it you'll have to add an exception for it.

this one click electroneum miner is using xmr-stak miner tailored for this project's purpose and requirements: ease of use and dev fee (dev has to survive too right?)

upcoming features:

1. support for x86 and/or AnyCPU
2. support for wallet ballence inquiry 
3. support for one time fee which will wave current dev fee
4. support for pool change, pool history and wallet ballance inquiry over the pool history
5. support for different coins: monero, sumokoin, ethereum, please suggest here more.
