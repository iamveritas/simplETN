One click electroneum miner (GPU + CPU), small step for author huge step for ETN mass adoption :) <3

For those wanting to mine ETN and didn't figure out the ins and outs (how to mine, how to create and manage a wallet, pools, etc.) this app will do it all for you.
After install you'll mine with one press of a button, safe, secure, easy; x64 windows only support for now, feedback welcomed, the intention behind this tool is exactly what Electroneum principle is: ease of use for mass adoption, __everyone should be able to easily use cryptocurrencies__.

__Features List:__
- it is mining using both GPU and CPU
- it is using your spare CPU so you can work in the same time and only when you are not using your CPU is hitting it 100%
- it is self tunning to maximize your computer potential, by auto configuring itself after the first run
- it can generate the ETN wallet while you are offline, so 100% secure/safe; after you generated the wallet and saved it securily, you can re-connect and start mining
- after setup, it is really a 1 click miner
- it is relying on xmr-stak all in one miner tailored for this project's purpose: ease of use, __everyone should be able to easily use cryptocurrencies__
- more to come

__Steps to Install:__

1. download zip file SimplETNApp-x64.zip (https://github.com/oviwankenobi/simplETN/raw/master/SimplETNApp-x64.zip), for now just x64 platform supported, 
2. unzip it on your local machine in a dedicated folder, 
3. launch simplETNApp.exe (you'll have to launch it as admin), 
4. if your antivirus complains about it you'll have to add an exception for simplETNApp, some antiviruses apps are making users aware they are dealing with a miner which is only fair.

__Upcoming features (features request, comments are welcomed):__

- support for x86 and/or AnyCPU
- instaler, updater
- support for wallet ballence inquiry (from pool and/or from blockchain)
- support for one time fee which will wave current dev fee
- support for pool change, pool history and wallet ballance inquiry over the pool history
- support for different coins: monero, sumokoin, ethereum, please suggest here more.
